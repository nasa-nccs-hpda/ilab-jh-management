Directories

Dev kernel link- in order see the “DEV kernel” in a JupyterLab session NB, you have to set the “kernel” sym link below to the Dev kernel you just created.

Testing

NBs-This suite could be increased. Test all other NBs in the repo as see fit.

Here's some basic ones: 

https://github.com/nasa-nccs-hpda/ilab-jh-management/tree/main/ilab-kernel-adapt/tests

Rapids-the rapids_cudf_pandas_accelerator_mode.ipynb needs the accompanying parquet files. So co-locate the NB with files down this path..

Top annoyances

-The ipywidgets, ipyleaflet dance between JupLab Env and kernel (see document 3 under “reference docs” above )
-Having to uninstall torchvision and reinstall it.  (See document 3).
-localtileserver “database error”. Can be solved by setting “PROJ_DATA” and “PROJ_LIB” at the top of your NB. (See document 3).
-gdal does not load the whole gdal-lib in anymore it loads gdal-core and then you install plugins such as libgdal-hdf4 libgdal-hdf5. Also, make sure you have exact versions of gdal between JupLab Env and Dev kernel. (In document 3 you can search for gdal to see detail of the journey on that).

Other notes

-in document 3 all the output from the installation was captured from latest build. This is helpful when you encounter dependency issues and need to specify a specific version during the env or kernel build.
